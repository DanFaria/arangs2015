the pipeline.  They will also use package management applications to install the
software needed to run the pipeline on their Virtual Machine.

The session will end with a discussion of docker concepts:
<ul>
  <li>Container Applications compared to Virtual Machine Images</li>
  <li>Volume Containers to permenantly store and share data</li>
  <li>Volumes to plug different host directories into the directory
  structure expected by a container application</li>

Docker Machine, and Docker Commandline

machine environment on any host machine within which docker images can be stored
and docker containers can be run.  Students will create their docker machine,
and learn how to configure the Docker commandline application to work with it.
Students will also learn how the Docker commandline's preconfigured knowledge
of the global docker hub registry can speed up their use of docker to design their
environments.
