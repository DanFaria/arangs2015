Building and composing docker containers
----------------------------------------
*2015-05-13*

On the previous day we learnt that docker containers are a more efficient way to package applications and data.  Today we will get a better understanding of how
to use this efficiency for our own purposes.  We will be building our own docker
images.  We will see how Docker allows us to create an almost universally
compatible package for each 'application' that is required in our analysis
pipeline.

We hope to accomplish the following learning goals:

Docker
------

- Docker containerized applications
- Dockerfile syntax
- Docker build contexts
- `docker-compose`
- How docker-compose can automate volume mounts to host locally stored data
- How the logging system can help debug applications.
